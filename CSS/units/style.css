/** Absolute Lengths:  The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size. */

/** Relative Lengths: Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium. */

/*? Pixels (px): px is an absolute unit of measurement in CSS, representing the smallest unit of screen space.
It provides a fixed and consistent size on all devices and screens. */

/*? Percentages (%): Percentages are relative units based on the parent element's size or the containing block.
Widely used in creating responsive layouts.
Example: width: 50%; sets an element's width to 50% of its parent's width. */

/*? Em (em): em is a relative unit that is calculated based on the font size of the parent element.
When you set an element's size in em, it's relative to the font size of its nearest parent with a specified font size. */

/*? Root Em (rem): rem is also a relative unit like em, but it's based on the font size of the root (html) element.
Using rem ensures that the size is consistent throughout the entire document, making it especially useful for responsive design. */

Certainly! The em unit in CSS is a relative unit that is based on the computed value of the font-size property of the nearest parent element. When you use em units for the font-size property within nested elements, it multiplies the value by the font size of its parent element.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how it works:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    body {
      font-size: 16px; /* Base font size for the entire document */
    /* }

    .parent {
      font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 times the base font size of the body */
    /* }

    .child {
      font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 times the font size of its parent (.parent) */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    This is the parent.
    <div class="child">
      This is the child.
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example:

The base font-size of the body is set to 16px.
The .parent class has a font-size of 1.5em, which means it will be 1.5 times the base font-size of the body, making it 24px (16px * 1.5).
The .child class, which is nested within the .parent class, also has a font-size of 1.5em. This will make the font size of the child 1.5 times the font size of its nearest parent, which is .parent. So, the child's font size will be 36px (24px * 1.5).
Keep in mind that the em unit can lead to compounding effects as elements are nested. If you want a font size that is always relative to the base font size of the document, you might consider using the rem unit, which is always relative to the root element's font size.

ehy we give font-size 62.5% to the html

Setting the font-size of the html element to 62.5% is a common technique used in CSS to make it easier to work with font sizes in a relative unit like rem.

By default, browsers have a base font size of 16px. When you set the font-size of the html element to 62.5%, it effectively sets the base font size to 62.5% of 16px, which is 10px (0.625 * 16). This makes calculations with rem units more straightforward, as 1rem becomes equal to 10px.

Here's an example: 

css
Copy code
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* Set the base font size to 10px */
}

body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* 1.6 * 10px = 16px */
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.4rem; /* 2.4 * 10px = 24px */
}

p {
  font-size: 1.4rem; /* 1.4 * 10px = 14px */
}
This technique makes it easier to work with a consistent and easily divisible base font size. It's especially handy when designing layouts and specifying font sizes using relative units, ensuring a more consistent and manageable scale throughout your stylesheets. Keep in mind that it's not a strict requirement, but rather a convention to make calculations more intuitive.
